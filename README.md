# FluxedOS
A hobbyist OS project!

This os is planning to be a ongoing project, if you would like to help out just submit a pull request!

## Note
* This OS is going to use all "our" code, you should try not to import any library or use code already written. 
* You can write code in any language, but C++ is recommended.
* I do allow other languages and their compilers / executables to import. Just not the core OS!.
