## FluxedOS ISO

This iso files will probably not boot on real hardware, there has been no tests on real hardware.

I can't stop you from running this on whatever you want, but this operating system comes with no warranty or liability for any damage that it causes.


## Running it

If you would like to run the OS. I would recommend you run it in qemu as that is the development environment and has been tested. VirtualBox and VMWare have not been tested.
